Bug
    Fix: race condition: virtual status may be immediately overriden by other status message (eg: alarm)
    Fix: if state is Check, then G-Code Parser, G-Code Params & Status must be blank
        Any $* command will fail, should not send them after sending a command
    Fix sync command G4 sometimes failing when jogging: "g-code locked out during alarm or jog state"
    Fix: sometimes status messages stop coming through and no command works anymore.
    InputFields

        Intercept M6
        Run macro, eg:
            Pause the machine (!).
            Move the spindle to a user-defined "Tool Change Position" (e.g., front of the machine).
            Wait for you to physically swap the bit.
            Run a Probe Cycle to measure the new tool length (critical step).
            Update the Z-zero height to match the new tool length.
