        FIX App.Stop() may be called from defer when the app failed to start, resoulting in segfault
        Navigate across buttons / input with tab / btab
        FIX M0
            the command response only will come after it is resumed
            we need to disable timeout if there's M0
            context needs to be cancelled on soft reset (and maybe others)
        Alarm state should cancel send command context

        implement stream
        fix
            when sendCommand times out before response message comes, it is discarded
