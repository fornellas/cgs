    virtual status report: Home
        When it is in alarm state (ie: hit limit switch), grbl is waiting for reset
            [MSG:Reset to continue]
                but the virtual state will be changed to Home
    FIXME do not send $G/$# for:
        $SLP, maybe others
    Scrolling
        Only scroll to end if view position is already at the end
            if not, change color to indicate there's new text
    Extra new line on top of Commands & Push Messages

    Connect timeout

    TextView logging
        debug why with DisableGroupEmoji=false, it wrecks UI (it looks like there's double last rune for every line that there's an emoji)
