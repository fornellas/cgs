Bug
    ControlPrimitiveQueueCommand
        various use cases where the channel is not used
        refactor to
            SendCommand(ctx context.Context, command string) error
    QueueRealTimeCommand
        it can error out
        refactor to
            SendRealTimeCommand(ctx context.Context, command string) error
    If state is check, skip status commands (or they'll fail)
    InputFields
        When it looses focus, the entered value is not applied

    Tool changing
        Intercept M6
        Run macro, eg:
            Pause the machine (!).
            Move the spindle to a user-defined "Tool Change Position" (e.g., front of the machine).
            Wait for you to physically swap the bit.
            Run a Probe Cycle to measure the new tool length (critical step).
            Update the Z-zero height to match the new tool length.

            Wayland

                Resizing
                    Slow, choppy
                    Sometimes render outside the window
                Cursor
                    Tiny
                Scaling
                    Bigger than it should be by default
                Fullscreen
                    Always goes to first monitor
                    When exit full screen, it sometimes offsets rendering (partially out of screen, mismatch with cursor position)
            No 3D option
