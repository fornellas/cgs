    Jogging UI buggy
        Bug
            [@jogging_primitive.go](file:///home/fornellas/src/cgs/control/jogging_primitive.go) review this file, and all places where JoggingPrimitive is used. The tview Application, when visualising this primitive, sometimes behaves erratically:
            - after interacting with the buttons & dropdown, without a repeatable pattern.
            - sometimes, most of the screen goes black, and only a single column of "garbage chars" can be seen at the far right.
