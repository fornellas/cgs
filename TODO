    Jogging UI buggy
        Bug
            [@jogging_primitive.go](file:///home/fornellas/src/cgs/control/jogging_primitive.go) review this file, and all places where JoggingPrimitive is used. The tview Application, when visualising this primitive, sometimes behaves erratically:
            - after interacting with the buttons & dropdown, without a repeatable pattern.
            - sometimes, most of the screen goes black, and only a single column of "garbage chars" can be seen at the far right.

Improvements
    Limit Jogging to work area fetched from $$
    internal/
    Add line limits to various TextView
    TextView logging
        debug why with DisableGroupEmoji=false, it wrecks UI (it looks like there's double last rune for every line that there's an emoji)
    Scrolling
        Only scroll to end if view position is already at the end
            if not, change color to indicate there's new text
