    control
        Change ScrollToEnd
            Only if current view is at the end of the text
            if not, change color to indicate there's new text
        when $H, grbl stops answering status requests, so we need to artificially update the state to match
        Split logs from push messages into separate text view
        Navigate across buttons / input with tab / btab
        FIX M0
            the command response only will come after it is resumed
            we need to disable timeout if there's M0
            context needs to be cancelled on soft reset (and maybe others)
        Alarm state should cancel send command context
        FIX App.Stop() may be called from defer when the app failed to start, resoulting in segfault
    grbl
        implement stream
        fix
            when sendCommand times out before response message comes, it is discarded
