Improvements
    Intermitent Push Message Status updates
        Some attributes (ie: cooling) are only reported in some
    internal/
    Connect timeout
    Add line limits to various TextView
    TextView logging
        debug why with DisableGroupEmoji=false, it wrecks UI (it looks like there's double last rune for every line that there's an emoji)
    Scrolling
        Only scroll to end if view position is already at the end
            if not, change color to indicate there's new text
