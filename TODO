Bugs
    Fix logging
        Need to use a logger handler proxy
            before App.Run, send to existing logger
            after App.Run, send to TextView
    FIXME do not send $G/$# for:
    $SLP, maybe others
    Shutdown issues
        control.RootPrimitive blocks randomly on shutdown (called from messageProcessorWorker)
    TextView logging
        debug why with DisableGroupEmoji=false, it wrecks UI (it looks like there's double last rune for every line that there's an emoji)
    Status panel "flickers" every 10-20s
    App.Stop() may be called from defer when the app failed to start, resoulting in segfault
        Can use SetAfterDrawFunc to identify successful start

Improvements
    internal/
    Connect timeout
    Add line limits to various TextView
    Scrolling
        Only scroll to end if view position is already at the end
            if not, change color to indicate there's new text
