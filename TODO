    Tool changing
        Intercept M6
        Run macro, eg:
            Pause the machine (!).
            Move the spindle to a user-defined "Tool Change Position" (e.g., front of the machine).
            Wait for you to physically swap the bit.
            Run a Probe Cycle to measure the new tool length (critical step).
            Update the Z-zero height to match the new tool length.
